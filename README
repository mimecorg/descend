Descend
Version 0.2 (2012-10-15)

Program for drawing 3D surfaces from parametric equations.

Descend is an open source program for drawing 3D surfaces from parametric
equations. It uses a custom, very fast language called Misc to calculate
the geometry. It also uses OpenGL to render scenes with high quality
shaders.

NOTE: OpenGL 3.3 or newer is required to run this program.
